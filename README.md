Whiteboarding Practice


Use your knowledge of data structures and time complexity to solve the following problems. These type of problems will not show up on the assessment but may be tested in coding interviews.

Be sure to apply Polya's Problem Solving framework when solving these problems:

Understand the problem
Devise a plan
Carry out the plan
Look back and refactor if necessary
In the context of this lesson, try to follow some of these steps when evaluating your solutions:

Determine and explain the time and space complexity of a function after you come to a solution
Discuss the potential for a more optimal solution
If a more optimal solution is discussed, implement that solution
